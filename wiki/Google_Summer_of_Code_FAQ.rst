Google Summer of Code FAQ
=========================

What is it?
-----------

`Google Summer of
Code <http://write.flossmanuals.net/gsocstudentguide/what-is-google-summer-of-code/>`__
(GSoC) is an internal program which aims on promoting Open Source
Software and teaching students contributing to it. For their efforts,
students are rewarded with stipends provided by Google. During summer
break students work on ideas for OSS projects while selected mentors
from the projects help them, provide support and review.

I want to apply to Google Summer of Code
----------------------------------------

Awesome! This is the right place to seek for more info. Keep on reading.

What are the requirements to be accepted for GSoC?
--------------------------------------------------

Apart from `official
requirements <https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq#what_are_the_eligibility_requirements_for_participation>`__
you will have to meet the following:

-  Successfully `clone and
   compile <https://libvirt.org/compiling.html>`__ libvirt
-  Subscribe to the `list <https://libvirt.org/contact.html#email>`__
-  Pass interview
-  Have a small upstream contribution

Wait, what interview?
---------------------

No worries. Interview is a great opportunity for both sides to ask
questions. It is usually done via IRC. It consists of a coding exercise
where you can prove your coding skills, and some generic chat about
programming, the project and idea you applied for. Some examples of
previous coding exercises can be found here:

-  `2013 <https://mprivozn.fedorapeople.org/gsoc/gsoc_exercise_2013.c>`__
-  `2014 <https://mprivozn.fedorapeople.org/gsoc/gsoc_exercise_2014.c>`__

How can I have an upstream contribution?
----------------------------------------

As strange as it might look like, this is a proof that you've managed to
clone and build your own libvirt and subscribed to the list. Don't
worry, there are no requirements on the initial contribution when it
comes to complexity or a size of the change. We keep a
`list <BiteSizedTasks.html>`__ of fairly easy
tasks for newcomers. Before working on a patch, please read `contributor
guidelines <https://libvirt.org/hacking.html>`__ and `project
governance <https://libvirt.org/governance.html>`__.

How to apply to Google Summer of Code?
--------------------------------------

Ideally, before applying for GSoC idea in the
`system <https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com>`__ you should contact the
respective mentor for the idea to discuss the idea, its requirements and
so on. A good application will require the following items:

-  Present yourself
-  Prove that you want to get involved into libvirt
-  Explain what you want to achieve
-  How do you plan to achieve it?
-  Why should we choose you?

What are my responsibilities as a student?
------------------------------------------

-  Communicate with your mentor weekly or more often
-  Post some patches during community bonding period
-  Write blog posts about your work

`Here <https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/help/responsibilities#student_responsibilities>`__
is a nicely summarized list of student responsibilities.

What can I expect from my mentor?
---------------------------------

-  They will be there for you
-  They will help you set up your development environment, answer
   technical questions
-  They will help you send your patches to the
   `list <https://libvirt.org/contact.html#email>`__
-  They will provide you with feedback on your progress

`Here <https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/help/responsibilities#to_your_students>`__
is a nicely summarized list of mentor responsibilities.

Is there a list of ideas for Libvirt?
-------------------------------------

`Sure <Google_Summer_of_Code_Ideas.html>`__.

I have my own not listed idea!
------------------------------

Wonderful! Send an e-mail to the mailing list in which you describe it
and we will get back to you.
