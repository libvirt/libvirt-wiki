This page tracks introductory tasks for new libvirt contributors. Code
cleanups, bugs, and small features are listed with difficulty ranging
from trivial to intermediate.

These tasks are good first introductions to libvirt code. You will be
required to get things building and make sure the test suite passes, but
not necessarily need to understand the details of what libvirt is doing.
Mostly these are following existing example changes that are already in
the code. Contact the listed mentor with any questions

These tasks are all tracked as `issues with the bitesizedtask
tag <https://gitlab.com/libvirt/libvirt/-/issues?label_name=bitesizedtask>`__
